Chase That Hare CSS update
==========================

In this, I first updated the HTML to remove center tags and line breaks that could have interfered with my CSS. I then created 6 div elements to encapsulate all of the blocks I wanted - one for the heading, one for the input boxes, with 2 more inside for each othe input boxes, one for the button, and one for the results. I then added colors and other minor visual touches.
